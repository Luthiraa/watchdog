# Weaviate Database Status

## Current Issue
Your Weaviate Cloud instance at `vngvk0virm6bevnxzttua.co.us-west3.gcp.weaviate.cloud` is not responding. This could be due to:

1. **Automatic Pause**: Weaviate Cloud free tier instances pause after 14 days of inactivity
2. **Instance Deletion**: Free tier instances may be deleted after extended inactivity
3. **Network Issues**: Temporary connectivity problems

## What User Data Would Look Like

If the database were accessible, you would see stored login information like:

```
üë§ Unique users found: 2

Users:
- user1@gmail.com
- user2@example.com

üìù Recent memories:
1. User: user1@gmail.com
   Content: Logged in via Google OAuth, created new account
   Time: 2025-09-24T10:30:00Z
   Category: authentication

2. User: user1@gmail.com  
   Content: Searched for "password security best practices"
   Time: 2025-09-24T10:32:15Z
   Category: search

3. User: user2@example.com
   Content: Logged in via Google OAuth, returning user
   Time: 2025-09-24T11:15:30Z
   Category: authentication
```

## To Set Up a New Weaviate Instance

### Option 1: Weaviate Cloud (Recommended)
1. Go to [Weaviate Cloud Console](https://console.weaviate.cloud/)
2. Sign up/Login with your Google account
3. Create a new cluster:
   - Name: `watchdog-memory`
   - Plan: Free tier
   - Region: Choose closest to your location
4. Once created, copy the:
   - **Cluster URL** (host)
   - **API Key**

### Option 2: Local Docker Instance
```bash
# Run Weaviate locally with Docker
docker run -d \
  --name weaviate \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -e QUERY_DEFAULTS_LIMIT=25 \
  -e AUTHENTICATION_ANONYMOUS_ACCESS_ENABLED=true \
  -e PERSISTENCE_DATA_PATH='/var/lib/weaviate' \
  -e DEFAULT_VECTORIZER_MODULE='text2vec-transformers' \
  -e ENABLE_MODULES='text2vec-transformers' \
  -e TRANSFORMERS_INFERENCE_API='http://t2v-transformers:8080' \
  -e CLUSTER_HOSTNAME='node1' \
  semitechnologies/weaviate:1.25.6

# Run the transformer model
docker run -d \
  --name t2v-transformers \
  -p 8081:8080 \
  -e ENABLE_CUDA=0 \
  semitechnologies/transformers-inference:sentence-transformers-all-MiniLM-L6-v2
```

Then update your `.env.local`:
```
WEAVIATE_HOST=localhost:8080
WEAVIATE_API_KEY=
```

## Update Your Configuration

Once you have a new Weaviate instance:

1. Update `.env.local` with your new credentials:
```env
WEAVIATE_HOST=your-new-cluster-url
WEAVIATE_API_KEY=your-new-api-key
```

2. Initialize the schema:
```bash
npm run init-weaviate
```

3. Query your users:
```bash
npm run query-users
```

## Current Application State

Your authentication system is fully configured and ready to use. Once you reconnect to a working Weaviate instance:

- ‚úÖ Google OAuth login works
- ‚úÖ User-scoped memory storage ready
- ‚úÖ Open-source embedding models configured 
- ‚úÖ Pixelated security theme active
- ‚è≥ Database connection needed

The app will work normally for authentication, but memory features won't function until the database is accessible.
