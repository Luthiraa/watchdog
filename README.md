# watchdog  
### autonomous memory agent for persistent web state  

you may not recall the page you opened two minutes ago, but watchdog maintains a continuous record of your search interactions. it builds a structured, queryable memory of browsing activity, enabling retrieval of transient context and associations that would otherwise be lost. designed to operate beyond conventional history, it functions as an adaptive layer between human recall and the dynamic web.
