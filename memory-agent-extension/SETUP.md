# Memory Agent Setup Guide

## Quick Setup Steps

### 1. Install the Extension
1. Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Enable "Developer mode" (toggle in top right)
3. Click "Load unpacked" 
4. Select the `memory-agent-extension` folder
5. The extension should appear in your toolbar

### 2. Fix Icon Issues (Optional)
The extension will work without icons, but to add proper icons:
- Create 4 PNG files: `icon16.png`, `icon32.png`, `icon48.png`, `icon128.png`
- Save them in the `icons/` folder
- Use any online icon generator or create simple brain/magnifying glass icons

### 3. Test the Vector Database

#### Option A: Add Test Data
1. Open any webpage
2. Open browser console (F12 â†’ Console tab)
3. Copy and paste the contents of `test-setup.js`
4. Press Enter to run it
5. This will add sample documents to test searching

#### Option B: Browse Some Pages
1. Just browse some websites normally
2. The extension will automatically capture page content
3. Give it a few minutes to collect data
4. Then try searching

### 4. Test the Search
1. Click the Memory Agent extension icon
2. Try searching for:
   - "JavaScript" (if you used test data)
   - "tutorial"
   - "programming"
   - Any topic from pages you've visited

## Troubleshooting

### "Search error: Cannot read properties of undefined"
This happens when:
- The background script isn't loaded properly
- No data has been captured yet

**Solutions:**
1. Reload the extension in `chrome://extensions/`
2. Add test data using the script above
3. Browse a few pages and wait 30 seconds
4. Check the browser console for errors

### No Search Results
This means:
- No data has been captured yet
- Your search terms don't match any stored content

**Solutions:**
1. Browse more websites
2. Use the test data script
3. Try broader search terms like "the", "page", "website"

### Extension Not Working
1. Check `chrome://extensions/` - ensure it's enabled
2. Look for error badges on the extension
3. Try reloading the extension
4. Check browser console for errors

## How It Works

1. **Content Capture**: When you visit pages, the content script extracts text
2. **Vector Storage**: Content is converted to vectors and stored locally
3. **Search**: Your queries are converted to vectors and matched using cosine similarity
4. **Results**: Most similar content is returned with relevance scores

## Data Storage

- All data is stored locally in your browser
- Uses Chrome's `storage.local` API
- No external servers or cloud storage
- You can export/clear data anytime

## Next Steps

Once working, you can:
- Export your data for backup
- Clear data if needed
- Integrate with external vector databases (future enhancement)
- Customize the search algorithm
